# Progressive Web Applications (PWA) Challenge: Text Editor

## Description

This innovative text editor is a prime example of the capabilities of Progressive Web Applications (PWA). Designed to operate seamlessly within a web browser, it also boasts the remarkable feature of functioning as a standalone desktop application, which users can install and use offline. This dual functionality addresses the versatile needs of modern users, offering both the convenience of in-browser editing and the reliability of a desktop application.

At its core, the application is a single-page application (SPA) that not only adheres to PWA criteria but also showcases advanced data persistence techniques. This ensures that the application remains fully functional and data remains intact even when a user is offline or when certain browser features are unavailable. The usage of IndexedDB, facilitated by the `idb` package, further enhances its capability to store and retrieve data effectively.
